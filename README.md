# Zotero-redownload-missing-PDFs
A JavaScript script for re-downloading missing PDFs after switching computers or experiencing a hard drive failure.

Have you switched to a new computer and found that, after syncing, your attachments were all missing? This is what I experienced when my old laptop broke and I could no longer access the hard drive. You can use this script to re-download all missing PDFs while automatically deleting the dead links.

## How to Use
1. Backup Your Data: Before running any batch script, it is highly recommended to back up your zotero.sqlite file.

2. Open JavaScript Runner: In Zotero, go to Tools -> Developer -> Run JavaScript.

3. Copy & Paste: Copy the code from script.js in this repository and paste it into the window.

4. Run: Click Run (or press Ctrl+Enter).

5. Confirm: A popup will appear asking for confirmation to scan your entire library.
